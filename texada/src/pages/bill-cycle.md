# Cycle Billing Day Codes

These are used to determine when the contract should be billed <br/>
If the calendar has been setup in **Calendar** with the default Cycle Billing Day codes, <br/>
Then the correct billing day code will automatically assigned to the contract <br/>
Typically, the codes are numeric, i.D Day 1 is code 1, Day 2 is code 2. etc.

#### To activate billing code
The customer needs to have a account with the firm <br/>
The account flag needs to set in **Customer Information** <br/>

<br />

#### How codes are picked
The codes were picked on either a monthly or 28 day basis.

* When billing monthly, the software always assigns the code equal to the calendar day. <br/>
e.g. the 14th day is always assigned to 14, the 20th day is always assigned code 20
* When billing 28 days, the code is assigned based on a 28 day cycle so that every 28 days, the cycle starts over again
